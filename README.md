# FiDELIS: Faithful Reasoning of Large Language Model on Knowledge Graph Question Answering

FiDELIS synergizes LLMs with KGs to enable faithful and interpretable reasoning. We present a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework, where RoG first generates relation paths grounded by KGs as faithful plans. These plans are then used to retrieve valid reasoning paths from the KGs for LLMs to conduct faithful reasoning.

Detailed implementation will be released later.
